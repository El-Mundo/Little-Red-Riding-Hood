# Little-Red-Riding-Hood
This is a Unity game project made for Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University's 2021 Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship, so it is only for educational and non-commercial use.
I am this game's director, graphic designer, scene designer, and programmer.
The project itself is made with Unity version 2020.1.17f1c1, and I collaborated with my research partner in coding for it.

The codes right under the "Little Red Riding Hood/Assests" folder (not in its sub-paths) and the "Little Red Riding Hood/Assests/TestFolder" are my work,which you can feel free to use.
However, codes in other paths, such as "Little Red Riding Hood/Assests/Scripts", are not my work, and their credits should go to their honoured owners (my research partner or providers of the included Unity packages).

The members who have contributed to this game and the research program about it were listed in the game's outro.

Warning: This project has included some external resoueces, which is owned by and subject to their honoured copyright holders.
I will delete them as soon as possible if illegle usage of external resources is informed.
Below I will list the external resources used in the version that was submitted to the university's research program.
There are also resources that are only used in legacy versions not listed below.
